                    <p>
                    I am a Graphic Designer and Production Artist originally from Brazil.
                    I was born and raised in an eclectic beach town called Salvador, known for its unique cuisine, music, and art scene.
                    My passion for graphic arts started when I was a little boy transferring images from catalogs to my notebooks.
                    This passion has been evolving along with the development of new softwares used to compose graphic layouts.
                    I have worked for Ad Agencies of various sizes over the last 10 years.
                    I have also worked as a freelance graphic artist for a diverse client base.
                    In 2012 I moved to San Diego looking for new opportunities, and to improve my English skills.
                    I soon realized this was the best decision I could have made.
                    Over the last six years I have laid the foundation for my future here in San Diego, and I hope to continue to expand my professional network while working with clients to bring their vision to life.
